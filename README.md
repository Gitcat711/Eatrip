### WorkFlow
 It is advised to fork or clone the repository and make local running test. All the changes and features can be added after running test locally and creating an issue. Please refer this [guide](https://github.com/dghubble/django-project-template) for more details on Environments, Static resources, adding apps and deployment. 
 
### Contribute
No matter the level of expertise, I would love to hear about the features and bugs project involves. Raise an [issue](https://github.com/Gitcat711/Eatrip/issues), make a [PR](https://github.com/Gitcat711/Eatrip/pulls). Even a miniscule contribution to the project would make it more meaningful and eventually more robust.
